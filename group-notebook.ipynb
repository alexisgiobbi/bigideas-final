    "Initially, we just started searching around the WPRDC for datasets that were relatively interesting and also had a neighborhood column, or something similar. We threw around some datasets like overdoses and obesity rates, among other things. After finding some datasets on firearm seizures and crime, we decided that safety was going to be the theme for our project."
