## Description 

We will use a grading scale to determine which neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are the best. We will add up the amount
of incidents per neighborhood for each dataset and compare them against a scale of the number of incidents.
This will proivde a ranking for each neighborhood of Pittsburgh with letter grades.
