## Description 

We are deciding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh using the datasets that are linked below. We did this by summing up each dataset's incidents per neighborhood and merging this into one dataframe. We accomplished this by using pandas, python, geopandas, and matplot.  

## Datasets

Firearm Seizures: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/e967381d-d7e9-48e3-a2a2-39262f7fa5c4

Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data: https://data.wprdc.org/datastore/dump/e03a89dd-134a-4ee8-a2bd-62c40aeebc6f

Non-Traffic Citations: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/non-traffic-citations

## Abstract

Our aim is to find the best neighborhood in Oakland. We will do so using three datasets: firearm seizures, police arrest
data, and non-traffic citations. The combination of our personal findings will amount to one metric for determining best.
dataset 3. This combination of our personal findings will combined into one metric for determining best. By our definition,
best is going to mean safest, and our individual datasets reflect that. 

Combining the datasets using pandas and totaling the amount of incidents, we found that Regent Sqaure is the safest, and by our metric therefore best, neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
